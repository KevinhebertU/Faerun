## [[Baldur's Gate]]
is LOSELY based on Faerun/forgotten realm myth. We are trying to keep things simple so all DMs can grasp. Here are some things we will be incorporating and things we will be straying from. 
- Mystal vs. Mystra, the weave
- Panthelon structure
- [[Spell Plague]]
- Faerun creation story
- Updated dragon war prior to the spell plague. 
- Differing planes of existence. We will not be using a strict interpretation of the lower/vs upper planes. Deities have their own home planets. They are in different planes of existence.  

## Eldrathia's creation myth
- is intertwined with the loose interpretation of Faerun lore. It centers around [[Eldraxis]], a dragon god who is said to still slumber beneath the continent's heart. It is believed that his dreams shape the land and influence the fate of those who inhabit it. Powerful dragons are revered as his earthly representatives.
- [ ] Connection between planets needs to be resolved. #KatieB ⏫
- Idea is this is Mystras home planet, that the magic here is saturated. Alternative story of Mystra and Eldrathia creation story for magic needs to happen. NOT based in Faerun lore. 
- Dragons were abundant, roaming around everywhere. Their magic likely leaked from this world, informed the weave, and tainted the world baldur gate resides in. 
- [[Gwendolyn Grimsbane]]  came into power at x time period. They believed that the role of the dragons was meant to serve the few powerful people that existed, herself included. She mutilated and corrupted some powerful dragons, launching the first dragon war.
	- She also drained magic from the planet, this is how she started to get so powerful.  
- This [[dragon war ]]is LINKED with the Faerun dragon war that happens. Alternative history. 
- The [[dragon war]] ripped across the entire continent, informing and shaping the countries that will be found. 
- The climax of the [[dragon war]] involved the good dragons locking [[Gwendolyn Grimsbane|Gwendolyn]] in a[[ time freeze]] for 1000 years. The rest of the planet moved on. 
- Consequences of this[[ time freeze]] was the [[Spell Plague]] on Faerun. It is the first time the weave got messed up, gods became personified. Also influences Mystra the most. Their transition from Mystral to Mystra is different as a result. 
- Powerful artifacts of Mystra, and stories of [[Gwendolyn Grimsbane|Gwendolyn]]'s ability to drain maigc leaked into the Faerun. They are mostly forgotten, or unknown to people. Except for [[Derrick]], who has gone insane as a result of having this information. 
- GATES use to work for portaling between places. Since the weave was messed up, they have not worked properly. 


## Coven members ([[Sisters of Compassion]])

- Two of our other BBEG have their own smaller story important to the lore. 
- Three rose up together in the village of [[Rockfell]], one a  [[Zaleria Thornheart|Bard witch]] , one [[Leylenna Shadowsoul|Healing witch]] , and one [[Primrose Drach|Guardian of nature witch]] 
- The [[Leylenna Shadowsoul|Healing witch]] and the [[Primrose Drach|Guardian of nature witch]]  loved each other, and the bard got the nature coven member killed accidently. The [[Leylenna Shadowsoul|Healing witch]]  never knew. 
- Years later, after trying to grow their power, the  [[Zaleria Thornheart|Bard witch]] went and found her lost sister who use to practice healing magic. The  [[Zaleria Thornheart|Bard witch]] heard stories of  [[Gwendolyn Grimsbane|Gwendolyn]] , and devised a plan to bring the continent to their home world so they could form a coven and each grow in power. 
- They knew this would be no small feat, and set out to find powerful artifacts they could drain the magic to set up a [[The ritual]]  that would tap into the heavens. 
- The [[Leylenna Shadowsoul|Healing witch]]  turned to necromancy, and discovered the secret that the  [[Zaleria Thornheart|Bard witch]] was responsible. Since then she has tried to increase power and resides as a noble in baldurs mouth, biding her time before she seeks revenge or gets strong enough to bring back her lost love. 
- The  [[Zaleria Thornheart|Bard witch]] has been developing a cult outside of baldurs gate, drains power from her followers in an attempt to increase her influence.**
