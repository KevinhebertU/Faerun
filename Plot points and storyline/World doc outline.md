**Things we need to sort before we release this:

- [ ] mystral vs mystra. #KatieB 

- [ ] how eldrathia informed fauren creation story.  #KatieB 
      I think this will be the easiest approach to have Edlrathia be the start of all worlds. Like magic dragons and mystra rippled out to everywhere else kinda vibe. And then events we wanna choose from forgotten realm lore we can add in. 

Organized this lore into acts for readability. There are a total of five:
- [[Act 0]], the preamble. Creation story and lore that exists prior to the start of the story. 
- [[Act 1]], the starting phase. This is the first official act of the story, the context builder. 
- [[Act 2]], the Mystras magic weave. This is the catalyist of change in the story. The motivation for character changes/growth and disturbances in the world. 
- [[Act 3]], the hydra head. This act allows players to explore different potential strategies and strings in response to the third act. They will be influencing who is the bbeg, allies, alliances, etc. 
- [[Act 4]] and finally, resolution. How do people react to the decisions players have made? How is the world settled? 

**Additions/ explanations of lore should be referenced by what act they are in to help keep track of time.

>**THIS IS THE WORKING STORY WE ARE ROLLING OUT** Please give us constructive feedback, if there are glaring holes we want to hear it. Things like, it doesn’t make sense that the coven would be able to bring a continent here and they grow in power, is SUPER helpful. But instead of scrapping what we have, need to adapt/alter and improve what we are working with. We are trying to keep this simple, and not go too deep into the weeds since we have several dms and staff. If things don’t make sense, ask in discord and we can chat about it. We also are working to transport everything to obsidian this week. But this is an overview of what we have in store.
