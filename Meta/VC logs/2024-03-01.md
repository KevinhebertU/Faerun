Mystra is a different planet, some event is bringing the continent to our plane
We want to branch out from Forgotten Realms so we don't have to obey all of the established lore.
A lunar phase or some cosmic event that only happen once every 1000 years made. They used it before to bound the witch (hags?)
The ritual is linked to the lunar phase thing. KatieB is doing a quest to foreshadow how big the ritual is/will be
The witches should be left very weak after [[The ritual]] 
We need to set boundaries to what the cosmic event can actually do.
The hags are using the ritual to bring Mystra (continent) to their world because they want to connect with a powerfull elf mage that is trapped in there.

Dragon underneath the continent (Which one ?)

Questions about dieties ? 

No more quest replacement to get into [[Bannerless Legion]].
Need to implement a  reward item limit for quest, maybe set a different limit for item vs consumable.

:RaLightBulb: Ideas for a multigroup quest that could involve more than 1 group working on different part of the same quest.
