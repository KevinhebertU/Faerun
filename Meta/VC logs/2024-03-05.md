Things I want to mention
- Start Acts at 0 (so that we start our server in act 1)
- Idea for Arden storyline quest
- Come up with more of the individual storyline idea 

[[Sir Gavrilo]] , wife died, he has a kid, might be linked with [[Arden Tern]] plot hook 
[[Seraphina Valaris Virezi|Seraphina]] , Soulmate is in the cult.
