*Injury poison*

Description

This one-page recipe is written in fine calligraphy on a sheet of clean white parchment. If you are proficient with alchemist’s supplies or a poisoner’s kit, you can make a dose of this poison with raw materials worth 250 gp and 1 hour of uninterrupted work. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 8 hours. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus. While poisoned in this way, a creature sheds bright green light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Any attack roll against the poisoned creature has advantage if the attacker can see them, and the affected creature can’t benefit from being invisible or hide from creatures who can see. Additionally, the creature leaves a glowing green trail whenever they move. The trail lasts until the creature is no longer poisoned.
