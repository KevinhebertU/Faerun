## Profile

Queen Bargnot, Scourge of the High Road, leads the [[Jagged Edge Bandits]] in pillaging caravans. Before her rise, the goblins struggled, attacking only the weakest travelers in unorganized strikes. When she killed her boss and became the bandâ€™s self-proclaimed queen, everything changed.
