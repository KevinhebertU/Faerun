## Backstory

Grew up an orphan at deepwater, escaped the orphanage as a kid, and lived on the street - at which time he eventually made a pact with a devil. Was in Urchin gangs and did petty crime using his magic and skills. Eventually at about 17 he stole something quite expensive, a bunch of his friends died, and he'd been in the run since. With the money from what he stole, he managed to get to baldur's gate, as well as buy his equipment. He thinks he is relatively safe here, and intends to do some interesting stuff, and see what this place has to offer while he's here.
